# ECOSTRESS Level 3 Evapotranspiration, Evaporative Stress Index, Water Use Efficiency

This will be the repository for the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) collection 3 level 3/4 evapotranspiration data products algorithm.

The ECOSTRESS collection 3 level 3/4 evapotranspiration data products algorithm is the pre-cursor to the [Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) collection 1 level 3/4 evapotranspiration data products algorithm](https://github.com/sbg-tir/SBG-TIR-L3-JET).
